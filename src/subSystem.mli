(** Abstract system 

    The functions and data types of this module are polymorphic in the
    actual source of the input system. See functions in {!InputSystem}
    to delegate to concrete implementations of an input format.

    A system is a set of subsystems, identified by a unique scope and
    containing instances of one other in a directed acyclic
    manner. Each system has at least an implementation or a contract,
    it may have both.
